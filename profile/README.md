# Theaceae Collective

ðŸ‘‹ Hello - we are the Theaceae Collective, a small organization that is creating awesome things!

Check out our projects:

### Camellia Wiki
- [**Wiki Frontend**](https://github.com/CamelliaCommunity/wiki-frontend): The latest and greatest version of the front-facing Camellia Wiki, developed using NodeJS via Vue. This is a complete rewrite, with new design, better navigation.
- [**Wiki Backend**](https://github.com/CamelliaCommunity/wiki-backend): The core of the Camellia Wiki's greatest features, written in C# via ASP.NET. The backend provides features such as comments, better article storage, authenication via Discord (and soon GitHub), and more.
- [**Wiki Articles**](https://github.com/CamelliaCommunity/wiki-articles): The heart of the Camellia Wiki. The articles are neatly organized and easy to write via Markdown.
- [**Wiki Legacy**](https://github.com/CamelliaCommunity/wiki): The current yet old Camellia Wiki. This is where it all started, powered by Jekyll.
